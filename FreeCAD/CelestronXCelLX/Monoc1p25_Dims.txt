* Need to add 4.28 mm to all radii in the top 5 cm of the tube.

* Need to add 3 mm to tube length to make it 82 mm long.

* Need to elongate the top thread to make it 13 mm long.

* Need to fashion a transition between the modified top 5 cm and the untouched bottom 3 cm


To help with this demo I have 
prepared a list of the parts that
need modifying and what to change
them to:

---------

Separate tube from adhesin (delete)

Undo 0.5 mm chamfer on innter top

Separate tube from baffles

Separate Monocular_tube_nobaffles into solid and cuts

Separate Monocular_tube_solid into simple and ThreadBS004

Make a copy of the Cylinder inside Monocular_tube_simple (it will become Cylinder811) and rename to

 Tube_top_solid

Reduce the height of the original Cylinder inside Monocular_tube_simple to 20 mm and change its z position to 14

Create a new Cone: Radius1 -> 19.18
                   Radius2 -> 14.9
                   z -> 4
Rename the cone: Trans_solid


Tube_top_solid: Radius -> 19.18
                Height -> 52
                z -> -48

Make a copy of Trans_solid and name it Trans_lumen: Radius1 -> 16.08
             Radius2 -> 11.8

Make a copy of Tube_top_solid and call it Tube_top_lumen: Radius -> 16.08

Now recombine the solid parts with a 'Union' of:
Tube_top_solid
Trans_solid
ThreadBS004
Monocular_tube_simple

Rename the fusion Monocular_tube_solid


---------


Separate Monocular_tube_cuts:

Separate Monocular_tube_lumen:
Note that has a placement of Z = -15 we need to correct for that when we separate the parts

The parts are:

Optical_aperture002 z: 47 -> 32

Chamfer:
    Cap_top_lumen002: z: -30 -> 12
                      height -> 20

(Recompute object on Chamfer)

Now recombine

Optical_aperture002
Chamfer
Trans_lumen
Tube_top_lumen

back into Monocular_tube_lumen

---

Now reposition Ocular_snuff_cap002 to fit our 3 mm extended tube:
 z: -53.50 -1 -> -56.5

Now make invisibile all but

Ocular_thread003:

First shift the whole thing down by 3 mm to fit our extended tube:

Ocular_thread003: z: 15 -> 12


We need to elongate the available thread by 5 mm so move the cropping cylinder inside it by 5 mm upwards:

Cylinder680 z: -52 -> -47



Expand the radii of the thread and snuff cone:

Ocular_thread003:
   Sweep_oc_ht_f003:
      Sketch_oc_ht_f003:
         Constraint10: 15 -> 19.28
   Cylinder680: 18 -> 22.28

Ocular_snuff_cap002:
   Cylinder682: 16 -> 20.28
   Cone019: Radius1: 5 -> 9.28
            Radius2: 15 -> 19.28

Now make a Union of:
Ocular_thread003
Ocular_snuff_cap002
Monocular_tube_lumen
Aperculae


and rename it Monocular_tube_cuts


Make the cut and rename it

 Monocular_tube_nobaffles


---------


Now open up the Baffles (note z offset of -15) and delete the two closest to the eyepiece:
Baffle_element_002
Baffle_element_003

Reform the Baffles and reinstate the -15 z offset.

Fuse (by Union) the Baffles to the tube and rename it:  Monocular_tube#

Re-do the 0.5 mm Chamfer on Monocular_tube# -> Monocular_tube_XCelLX


-------


Shift the Adhesin down by 3 mm to take account of the new length


Increase diameter of adhesin aperture.

Monocular_tube_adhesin:
   Pads:
      Cut396:
         Cylinder683: 14.25 -> 18.53

      Cylinder705: 11.50 -> 15.78

Recompute object


Fuse the tube with the adhesin, mesh, export and print.
